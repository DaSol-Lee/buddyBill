## Overview
### Description
Convenient way to split a bill among friends. 
Snap a picture of the receipt and tap the items to claim them. 
This iOS app will generate what each person will pay, including the tax and tip.


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social/ Finance
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. 
- **Story:** Allows user to take a picture of their receipt. Each person can select the items that they ordered, and multiple people can select the same item if they shared it. The tax and tip are divided proportionally.  
- **Market:** Anyone who needs group pay! 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the individual has to split bills with a group.
- **Scope:** Large potential to become widely used like Venmo and traditional calculators!
