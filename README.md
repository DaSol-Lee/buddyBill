## Overview
### Description
Buddy Bill provides a convenient way to split a bill among friends. 
Snap a picture of the receipt and tap your items to claim them. 
This iOS app will generate what each person will pay, including the tax and tip.

### Current Limitations
- Can only process english receipts
- Does not handle currency symbols
- Receipt readings are not always accurate

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social/Finance
- **Mobile:** This app is developed for mobile devices but would be just as viable on a computer. 
- **Story:** Users take a picture of their receipt. Each person can select the items that they ordered, and multiple people can select the same item if they shared it. The tax and tip are divided proportionally. A new 'bill' is generated indicating what each person will pay.
- **Market:** Anyone who needs to split the bill! 
- **Habit:** App usage depends on how often a user needs to split bills with others.
- **Scope:** Large potential to become widely used like Venmo and traditional calculators!
